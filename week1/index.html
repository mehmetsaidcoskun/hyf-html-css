                    Hi there! My date of birth is 26th February 1990. I have borned 
                    and lived during 27 years in Turkey. Since december 2017 I have 
                    lived in the Netherlands and from now on I will keep living here.
                    My home is in Hoogstraat 8, Leersum.

                <p>
                    I am married for almost two years. My lovely wife is Nedime. We 
                    have no kids yet. She and I are very new in the Netherlands, that's 
                    why we are trying to be naturalized and to build a new and bright 
                    future for us. By the way we love to be here.
                </p>

                    I had studied at Fatih Science and Anatolian Private High School for 
                    four years as a full scholarship student. On 2008, I ranked top 27 
                    among over 1,5 million students in the university entrance exam in 
                    Turkey and I deserved to get into Bilkent University Law Faculty with 
                    the full scholarship. I got my bachelor diploma on 2013 with success.

                <p>
                    After my graduation, I started to work at Turgut Ozal University as a 
                    teaching assistant. Unfortunately, the Turkish Government shut our 
                    university down on my wedding day in mid-2016. Then despite lots of 
                    political obstacles, I started to do attorney trainee. I have been making 
                    a strong impression on Ankara Bar Association and Gazi Law Firm. 
                    Although I was just an attorney trainee, the clients of the law firm 
                    have been wanted to meet me when they had a trouble. But again, the 
                    government stopped my attorney traineeship in October 2017. Soon after, 
                    I went to Greece with a heavy heart. Then I came to the Netherlands to 
                    apply for asylum.
