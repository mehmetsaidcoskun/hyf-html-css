				The army's most common vehicle is the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), 
				commonly called the HUMVEE. It has largely supplanted the roles previously performed 
				by the original jeep, and others such as the Vietnam War-era M151 jeep, the M561 
				"Gama Goat", their M718A1 and M792 ambulance versions, the Commercial Utility Cargo 
				Vehicle (CUCV), and other light trucks. Primarily used by the United States military, 
				it is also used by numerous other countries and organizations and even in civilian 
				adaptations.

				The M1A2 ABRAMS is the army's main battle tank. Highly mobile, designed for modern 
				armored ground warfare, the M1 is well armed and heavily armored. Notable features 
				include the use of a powerful multifuel turbine engine, the adoption of sophisticated 
				composite armor, and separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment for crew safety.

				One of the U.S. Army's principal artillery weapons is the M109A6 PALADIN self-propelled 
				howitzer. It has been upgraded a number of times, most recently to the M109A7. 
				The M109 family is the most common western indirect-fire support weapon of maneuver 
				brigades of armored and mechanized infantry divisions. The M109 is fitted with night-vision 
				equipment, but does not have nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) warfare protection. 
				The vehicle can be fitted with an amphibious kit consisting of nine air bags, four on each 
				side of the hull and one at the front.

					It must perform in a wide variety of terrain, from deserts to jungles, 
					for long periods of time, with minimal maintenance. It has to carry its 
					cargo and occupants in safety while dodging instruments of war — bullets, 
					bombs and mines.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Its 15 configurations (cargo/troop carriers, weapons carriers, ambulances 
					and shelter carriers) share a common engine, chassis and transmission, with 
					44 interchangeable parts that are used in more than one position. That means 
					fewer training hours are necessary for the mechanics who will maintain it.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					HMMWVs are maintainable, reliable and survivable. They meet all of these requirements 
					while incorporating new standards of reliability for combat vehicles. They score high 
					on Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Durability (RAM-D) requirements 
					and specifications. During initial production tests, the new vehicle proved to be 
					nearly twice as durable as the Army required.

				&emsp;Approved for production in 1990, the M1A2 represents the U.S. Army’s technological 
				improvement of the basic M1A1 design and the most modern battle tank in the world.
				<br>
				&emsp;Internally, however, the M1A2 has been radically redesigned to take advantage of newer 
				technology. Most notable of these improvements is the addition of the Inter-Vehicle Information 
				System (IVIS.)  
				<br>
				&emsp;In addition enemy positions can be identified, plotted and disseminated, while reports 
				and artillery requests can be automatically formatted, transmitted, and processed. 
				<br>
				&emsp;Lastly, map graphic control measures and operational orders can be rapidly distributed 
				via the IVIS system. Power distribution throughout the tank has been improved, relying on 
				multiple bus paths so that in the event one conduit is damaged, power may still be delivered 
				to a component via an alternate path. The driver's instrument display has been upgraded to a 
				more detailed digital display and the Gunner's Primary Sight has been stabilized in two axes 
				for increased accuracy.

				&emsp;The Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) was ordered from Newport News Shipbuilding on Sept. 
				10, 2008, and is scheduled to be delivered in 2016. Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers 
				and carrier strike groups will provide the core capabilities of forward presence, deterrence, 
				sea control, power projection, maritime security and humanitarian assistance.
				<br>
				&emsp;Each ship in the new class will save more than $4 billion in total ownership costs 
				during its 50-year service life, compared to the Nimitz-class. The CVN 78 is designed to 
				operate effectively with nearly 700 fewer crew members than a CVN 68-class ship.
				<br>
				&emsp;The new A1B reactor, Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System, Advanced Arresting Gear 
				and Dual Band Radar all offer enhanced capability with reduced manning. The ship’s configuration 
				and electrical generating plant are designed to accommodate new systems, including direct energy 
				weapons, during its 50- year service life.

				&emsp;Designed during the Cold War as the world’s first low-observable or “stealth” 
				strategic bomber. The bomber represents a major milestone in the U.S. bomber modernization 
				program and brings massive firepower to bear anywhere on the globe through previously 
				impenetrable defenses.
				<br>
				&emsp;The B-2 provides the penetrating flexibility and effectiveness inherent in manned 
				bombers. Its low-observable characteristics give it the unique ability to penetrate an 
				enemy's most sophisticated defenses and threaten its most valued, and heavily defended, 
				targets. Its capability to penetrate air defenses and threaten effective retaliation provides 
				a strong, effective deterrent and combat force well into the 21st century.
				<br>
				&emsp;Its low-observability provides it greater freedom of action at high altitudes, 
				thus increasing its range and a better field of view for the aircraft's sensors. 
				Its unrefueled range is approximately 6,000 nautical miles (9,600 kilometers).

				&emsp;The E-4B is a converted 747-200 operated by the U.S. Air Force, and one of these 
				aircraft is aloft and ready to take charge of a nuclear crisis at all times.
				<br>
				&emsp;In case of attack, the President, Vice President, or the Joint Chiefs of Staff would 
				meet up with the E-4B at a secret location and assume control of remaining American nuclear 
				forces. The E-4B would then fly a classified route over the United States, skirting 
				obvious nuclear targets, theoretically staying in the air for days at a time with the 
				help of Air Force midair refueling tankers.
				<br>
				&emsp;The E-4B has advanced secure communications systems that would allow it to remain in 
				contact with America's nuclear forces in wartime. It is also protected against the effects 
				of electromagnetic pulse, a surge of electromagnetic radiation released by a nuclear explosion 
				that can knock out electrical and computer systems. The airplanes are also used by the 
				Secretary of Defense when he travels overseas, to provide a secure communications platform 
				and a means to whisk him or her to safety in a crisis.

				<li>
					The F-22 Raptor is considered the first 5th-generation fighter in the U.S. 
					Air Force inventory, using low observable technologies, modern avionics and 
					efficient engines to offer an air superiority fighter unmatched by any other 
					modern military.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					The F-22 Raptor, a critical component of the Global Strike Task Force, is designed 
					to project air dominance, rapidly and at great distances and defeat threats 
					attempting to deny access to our nation's Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps. 
					The F-22 cannot be matched by any known or projected fighter aircraft.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Advances in low-observable technologies provide significantly improved survivability 
					and lethality against air-to-air and surface-to-air threats. The F-22 Raptor brings 
					stealth into the day, enabling it not only to protect itself but other assets.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					The F-22 will have better reliability and maintainability than any fighter aircraft 
					in history. Increased F-22 reliability and maintainability pays off in less manpower 
					required to fix the aircraft and the ability to operate more efficiently.
